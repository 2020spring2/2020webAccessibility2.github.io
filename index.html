			<h2>Text</h2> 
				<h3>Page Title</h3>
					<p>The title of your page is what is shown in the title bar in a few browsers and shown on the tab. They are also what appear in the search engine results. One of the most important things to do with your page's title is to place the most important information at the beginning of the title as some titles become too long for the tab to show. You should always test your title in multiple browsers to make sure it can accurately be read by more than just your default.</p>
				<h3>Fonts</h3>
					<p>One of the most important things to take into account when creating a website is the fonts that you will use. You should make sure that your font is simple and large, as that is the easiest font to read. Most websites tend to stick to the basic fonts like Times, as they are widely used and very easy to read. To make your website the most accessible, you should use fonts that are simple, and not trying to mimic handwriting.</p>
				<h3>Headings</h3>
					<p>The Headings of your website should be Large and in a Font that is structured and looks like a typed document. The headings are the fastest navigation throughout your website and they should be concise and specific as to what you are putting in the paragraph below them. For instance, to find this paragraph you would first find the 'Text' heading, then, you would search for the 'Headings' heading, and you would find this excerpt.</p>

			<div class="content" id="picture">
			<h5 class="backToTop"><a href="#title">Back To Top</a></h5>
				<h2>Pictures, Illustrations, Charts</h2>
					<h3>'Alt' Text</h3>
						<p>The 'alt' text of the image(or illustration, or chart, and etc.) that is shown is designed to describe the image if it does not load on the page or if someone is using a screen reader. This text should inform the reader of what the content you have chosen is trying to explain in a format that is easily understandable. For instance, the 'alt' text for the image to the right is: "Cartoon Campfire PNG" On the other hand it may also be unnecessary to have alternative text for an image, if I had a second image of a campfire for the same reason I had the first, it may only be needed to have 'alt' text for the first. In that case, the input for the image's alt would be "null."<br>

		<div class="content" id="videoAudio">
			<h5 class="backToTop"><a href="#title">Back To Top</a></h5>
			<h2>Video and Audio</h2>
				<h3>Alternatves to Video and Audio Content</h3>
					<p>For those who are hard of hearing or deaf, there has to be other forms of content that can provide information if the content has any audio. Things like these include captioning and text transcripts that can be read as an alternative to listening. For those who are blind or have low vision can't watch videos so an alternative for that would be an audio description of what is hapening in the video or text that can be read by a screen reader.</p>
				<h3>Blinking, Moving, or Flashing Content</h3>
					<p>This type of content includes anything that involvese motion on the screen, this can include but is not limited to: </p>
					<ul>
						<li>-Advertisements</li>
						<li>-Videos</li>
						<li>-News Feeds</li>
						<li>-Slideshows</li>
					</ul>
					<p>All of these can be distracting from content or if the content within them is scrolling, it may be too fast to read for some viewers. To counteract these problems, it is suggested that you put a setting to stop or slow down any distracting or scrolling content, especially if it starts on your page automatically. It is also helpful if you have a transcript be available for any content that may move to quickly.</p>

			<h2>Structure</h2>
				<h3>Background Vs. Content Color Contrast</h3>
					<p>For people who have trouble reading certain colors require that you keep the contrast between the background of your webpage and the content at high degree. Some people also need text at a low luminance, some people with reading disabilities such as dyslexia cannot read bright text, so they require a lower brightness on content. For instance this first example shows a high contrast and the second shows a low luminance, the colors used are displayed below the example.</p>
					<div class="colors">
						<p id="highContrast">This is an example of a high contrast background to content ratio. This is done so those with colorblindness and other reading disabilities can read the content.</p>
						<p class="colorExplained">The Colors Used in the example above are: Bright Blue(#02FFFD) and Deep Brown(#270000)</p>
					</div>
					<div class="colors">
						<p id="lowBright">This is an example or a low luminance background and content. This is done so those with dyslexia and other reading disabilities can read the content.</p>
						<p class="colorExplained">The Colors Used in the example above are: Black(#000000) and Light Brown(#A28364)</p>
					</div>
		</div>
		
		<div class="content" id="interact">
			<h2>Interactivity</h2>
		  		<h3>Keyboard Access</h3>
					<p>When someone hovers over any link on the website, you want it to be obvious and visible, because some people with impairments that make it hard for them to navigate websites and the ability to know where their cursor is located is an essential function needed in an accessible website. For instance when you hover over <b>This Text</b>, it's background and the text will switch colors, the background being black and the text being the light orange.</p>
				<h3>Screen Reader Compatibility</h3>
		  			<p>To be compatible with a screen reader is not as hard as it sounds. In fact, if you follow everything previously mentioned above this section, your website should be fully compatible. For compatibility, you need alt text for your images, clear indicators of where the mouse is, alternatives to video content, and a few other things.</p>

			<h2>How To Test Your Website</h2>
				<p>Of course, once you implement all these things to make your website as accessible as possible, you can't know if you did it correctly. There are a few ways to figure it out. Checking it by using the soft- or hardware that you designed it for: running the website through a screen reader or things similar. You can also run your website through another website that tests yours. The two that have been used on this website are the World Wide Web Consortium's(W3C) HTML5 and CSS3 tester. These make sure that your code is correctly formatted. The links to these two websites are listed below this paragraph. There are many websites that are recommended for testing a websites accessibility, they can be found on the W3C's official website, linked at the bottom of the page.</p>
