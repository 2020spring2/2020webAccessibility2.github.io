			<h2>Text</h2>
				<h3>Page Title</h3>
					<p>The title of your page is what is the shown in the title bar in a few browsers and shown on the tab. They are also what appear in the search engine results. One of the most important things to do with your page's title is to place the most important information at the beginning of the title as some titles become too long for the tab to show. You should always test your title in multiple browsers to make sure it can accurately be read by more than just your default.</p>
				<h3>Fonts</h3>
					<p>One of the most important things to take into account when creating a website is the fonts that you will use. You should make sure that your font is simple and large, as that is the easiest font to read. Most websites tend to stick to the basic fonts like Times, as they are widely used and very easy to read. To make your website the most accessible, you should use fonts that are simple, and not trying to mimic handwriting.</p>
				<h3>Headings</h3>
					<p>The Headings of your website should be Large and in a Font that is structured and look like a typed document. The headings are the fastest navigation throughout your website and they should be concise and specific as to what you are putting in the paragraph below them. For instance, to find this paragraph you would first find the 'Text' heading, then, you would search for the 'Headings' heading, and you would find this excerpt.</p>

			<div class="content" id="picture">
				<h2>Pictures, Illustrations, Charts</h2>
					<h3>'Alt' Text</h3>
						<p>The 'alt' text of the image(or illustration, or chart, and etc.) that is shown is designed to describe the image if it does not load on the page or if someone is using a screen reader. This text should inform the reader of what the content you have chosen is trying to explain in a format that is easily understandable. For instance, the 'alt' text for the image to the right is: "Cartoon Campfire PNG" </p>

			<h2>Video and Audio</h2>
				<h3>Alternatves to Video and Audio Content</h3>

Things like these include captioning and text transcripts that can be read as an alternative to listening. For those who are blind or have low vision can't watch videos so an alternative for that would be an audio description of what is hapening in the video or text that can be read by a screen reader.</p>
